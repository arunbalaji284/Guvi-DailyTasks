2)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

In simple terms. “A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behavior (properties and method)”.
For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc.

1)Objects:
The following code assigns a simple value (Mercedes) to a variable named car:
var car = "Mercedes";
Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

The following code assigns many values (Mercedes, C-class, White and soo on) to a variable named Car:
var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: “850kg”, Mileage: “8Kmpl”, Rating: 4.5};
The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

Syntax:
var <object-name> = {key1: value1, key2: value2,... keyN: valueN};
So, conclusion and definition for JS objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.

2)Object Properties

The name:values pairs (in JavaScript objects) are called properties.
var car = {Make: “Mercedes”, Model: “C-Class”, Color: “White”, Fuel: Diesel, Weight: 2000“

So, Conclusion and simple definition for Java Script objects is “JavaScript objects are containers for named values”.
and defination of Javascript properties is “Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object”.
